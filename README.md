super-analyzer
==============

The Super Analyzer analyzes your iTunes music library and gives you interesting statistics. For example, visually see how many songs you have in each genre or from each decade, or see what time of day you listen most often.

To build the application, create a new project in Eclipse, add the src files, add external jar references to the three jar files, and then run as a Java Application using the main() method in the net.nosleep package.
